    views/partials/: Contains layout fragments like:

        header.ejs – Site branding & nav

        footer.ejs – Footer area

        sidebar.ejs – (Optional) admin navigation

Sample Layout Integration:

<!-- views/index.ejs -->
<%- include('partials/header') %>

<div class="container mt-4">
  <h2>Welcome to Admin Panel</h2>
  <p>Use navigation to manage employees and tasks.</p>
</div>

<%- include('partials/footer') %>

🛡️ 9. Security & Validation (Suggestions)

    Sanitize input to avoid injection attacks

    Add validation checks for required fields

    Use express-validator or similar middleware

    Implement session-based login in future versions
